**Market Volatility and Model Trustworthiness:**

**Market Volatility:**
Based on the data, the Dutch power market is **highly volatile**. The enormous spread between the maximum forecast price of 279.28 EUR and the minimum forecast price of -12.35 EUR (a range of over 290 EUR) unequivocally indicates extreme price swings. The potential for significant price spikes alongside periods of negative pricing points to a market heavily influenced by intermittent renewables, demand fluctuations, and grid constraints, requiring constant vigilance and agile trading.

**Model Trustworthiness (based on MAE):**
An MAE (Mean Absolute Error) of 30.36 EUR is **significant** relative to the average forecast price of 94.92 EUR, representing roughly 32% of the average. This suggests that while the model can provide valuable directional insights and identify potential extreme events (like the high peaks and negative prices), its precise point forecasts will have a considerable margin of error. Therefore, while the model is trustworthy in revealing the overall trend and highlighting market volatility, it should be used with caution for exact price levels and integrated with other qualitative and real-time market intelligence rather than relied upon solely for pinpoint accuracy.
