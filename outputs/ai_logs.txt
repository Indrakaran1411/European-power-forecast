**Market Volatility and Model Trustworthiness:**

**Volatility:**
Yes, the Dutch power market is demonstrably **highly volatile** based on these forecasts. The projected range from negative prices (-12.35 EUR) to extreme peaks (279.28 EUR) clearly indicates significant intra-day or intra-week price swings. Negative prices are a strong indicator of oversupply situations (often driven by high renewable generation with low demand), while the high maximum price points to potential scarcity events, tight supply margins, or high demand peaks. This market structure offers both significant profit opportunities and substantial risk.

**Model Trustworthiness (based on MAE):**
The model's trustworthiness, based solely on the MAE of 30.36 EUR, is **moderate**. Given an average forecast price around 95 EUR, an average error of over 30 EUR represents a substantial deviation margin (roughly 32% of the average price). While the model can provide valuable directional insights and identify the potential for extreme price events (which is crucial in a volatile market), its specific point forecasts carry a considerable degree of uncertainty. This suggests that while it's a useful tool for macro trends and risk identification, trading decisions requiring precision would need to factor in this error margin and potentially integrate other real-time market signals or apply wider risk buffers.
